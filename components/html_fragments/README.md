# HTML Fragments for the components

Currently unused except for tests rather than rewriting, document initialization
Ideally, we'd imagine that these fragments are easily imported into index.html
but that would require learning how to use a static site generator such as
Jekyll. For now, just copy and paste this into index.html manually.
