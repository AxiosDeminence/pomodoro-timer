# [User annotated picture for help page]

* Date: [2021-01-31]

## Context and Problem Statement

[We are trying to provide an instruction for first time users or users that neen help using our webapp.]

## Considered Options

* [pop-up window, a new tab to help the user]
* [pop-up bubbles/animations directly on the page pointing each functionality and explain]
* [annotated picture with explianation]

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[option 3]", because [Instead of building another site or adding resources-consuming actions, an annotated picture is much more faster and easier to implement. It doesn't
require a lot resources nor computation, just download an extra png/pdf with details instruction to fulfill the task].
