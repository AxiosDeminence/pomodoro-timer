## Absent Members
- Kaiwen Tan (notified in advance)

## Discussion Points/Ideas
- Repo Reviews
  - Brian's Repo
    - Interests & Usefulness: Pomodoro Timer. Generally useful and interesting for time management and its simplicity.
    - Documentation: No README and unhosted documentation files in HTML format making quick review difficult.
    - CI/CD Pipeline: Static assets of pipeline plans.
    - Code Quality: JavaScript is nicely commented but a bit difficult to navigate. HTML should be more semantic.
    - Capability: Basic web technologies without frameworks makes it easy for us to work on.
  - Leo's Repo
    - Interests & Usefulness: No understanding what the app does and no demo.
    - Documentation: N/A
    - CI/CD Pipeline: N/A
    - Code Quality: Unfamiliar with Android for Java but no commenting
    - Capability: Most of us don't know Android development.
  - Brooks' Repo
    - Interests & Usefulness: App is simple and useful for those wanting to learn to cook.
    - Documentation: JSDocs of all functions but not very helpful. Cursory onboarding but nothing about repo organization and how everything works together.
    - CI/CD Pipeline: Instructions and diagrams showing the pipeline flow, but there is a testing server.
    - Code Quality: Decently organized but comments aren't very detailed. Need more time to see how navigation is.
    - Capability: Requires MongoDB, but willing to learn and doesn't appear too complicated.
  - Jimmy's Repo
    - Interests & Usefulness: Recipe manager but interest varied on the individual reviewer.
    - Documentation: Very sparse code documentation but some high-level diagrams.
    - CI/CD Pipeline: Non-existent but has unit testing.
    - Code Quality: Varying readability but reasonable functions and names.
    - Capability: CRUD functions are not complete and may take lots of work to complete.
  - Patrick's Repo
    - Interests & Usefulness: Pomodoro timers are useful but not too interesting.
    - Documentation: Very detailed onboarding documentation for developers and end-users.
    - CI/CD Pipeline: Lots of tests, linting, doc generation, and automation.
    - Code Quality: Some hard-coded areas but well organized.
    - Capability: Uses only core web technologies so easy to work on.
  - Juhmer's Repo
    - Interests & Usefulness: Pomodoro timer but cannot be extended that far
    - Documentation: User onboarding but no developer onboarding.
    - CI/CD Pipeline: Strong CI/CD pipeline with integration and unit testing.
    - Code Quality: Well organized and good commenting but lots of repeated code and hard-coded areas.
    - Capability: Uses only core web technologies. 
  - Zian's Repo
    - Interests & Usefulness: Could be interesting but low reusability.
    - Documentation: N/A
    - CI/CD Pipeline: E2E and unit testing but manual.
    - Code Quality: Well-factored and structured but hard to understand without documentation.
    - Capability: No clue how to do Java for Android.
  - Kai's Repo
    - Interests & Usefulness: Good design and interesting use-case
    - Documentation: Sparse documentation for repo and code
    - CI/CD Pipeline: N/A
    - Code Quality: Well-organized with sparse comments and function headers
    - Capability: No firebase experience and Discord API
  - Totay's Repo
    - Interests & Usefulness: Does solve a problem but only for a proprietary group of people
    - Documentation: N/A
    - CI/CD Pipeline: N/A
    - Code Quality: Well-factored with short functions.
    - Capability: Would need to learn new technologies

- Weekly meeting Times

## Decisions
- Weekly Meetings will be moved to Fridays at 4 PM
