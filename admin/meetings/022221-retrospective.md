# First retrospective meeting note

## Glad

- Consistent meetings on Sunday and Thursdays
- Good meeting attendence
- No late assignments
- We were able to finish on time
- Front End was able to good progress and stay on schedule, good for backend to get started

## Sad

- We miss the due data and lost the point.
- The CI/CD pipeline is not fully built, needs to be built ASAP
- No progress updates between team members or use of slack channel
- Uneven distribution of work

## Decisions 

- Front-end helps out back-end once they have a pretty good progress
- make daily update in progress-update channel
- more communication within the team
- Kenneth moves to the CI team
