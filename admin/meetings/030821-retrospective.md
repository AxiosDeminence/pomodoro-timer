# Second retrospective meeting note

## Glad

- I'm glad we were able to get a lot done
- We are really productive, better communication since last sprint and flexible in switching roles and helping out each other.
- We can learn a lot of team work in this project.
- That sound when you click a button tho
- CI/CD pipeline got some major upgrades and is looking a lot more organized. s/o to Jasmine for trailblazing this.

## Sad 

- slack channel is not used well enough
- Some of assignment we lose some point because the summit late time.
- Cypress coverage report is not working :(
- Miss the ddl of one assignment

## Decision

- Jackie is working on the coverage report now. Seek help from TA if needed
- We have HanJie keeping track of the assignment ddl now
