## Absent Members
- Patrick Chiang
- Zian Lin

## Discussion Points/Ideas
- Team Name
  - Pick a theme? Could be good for team identity/solidarity
  - Name: Gallant Tech? First row?
  - Gigachad team mascot LOL
  - Considered names (decided on vote):
    - Gigachad
    - Gallant Tech
    - First Row
    - Big Lunchbox
    - Goofus
    - Soapbox Warriors
- Mission/Shared Goal
  - Reliability (reliable software, also as a team able to rely on each other?)
  - Transparency/open communication
  - Be the best team with the best software that has the best quality code?
    - Best team, best software, best quality code, best and biggest lunchboxes
  - Give everyone opportunities to gain experience in different areas (Product design->technical design->technical development->quality assurance,front end vs back end)
- Considered introduction video ideas
  - Brian's idea
  - Rap humble parody?
  - Video game
  - Basketball
- Operating Rules
  - Come up with a plan for communications? Who needs to be notified about what types of info, when or how often? 
  - Async daily standups on a slack channel?
  - Could be a good idea to have everyone commit to at least 10 minutes everyday just to read through the slack channel, look at repo updates, etc to stay up to date with what’s going on (even if you don't have time to actually work on tasks everyday)
  - Discussing the general schedule of the course and how to pace ourselves? (they pretty much outlined what we should have done each week) 
  - Form front end group and back end group depending on strength and interest? Reassign every week?
  - Suggested workflow: 
    - Meeting and events planning - Patrick will handle this
    - Product or feature design - discuss and conclude during weekly meetings. UI design handled by Leo.
    - Technical design - depending on how complex our project is, important design decision needs to be reviewed by the team
    - Development - individual or pair programming (use the same code formatter)
    - Code review options:
      1. We can form a front end code review team and backend code review team, or we can alternate.
      2. We can split into different small groups each week, and the group members will handle code review internally
    - QA - if we go with option 2 for code review, we can do QA within each group internally, or we can just do round robin and give everyone equal numbers of QA
- Availabiliy + Effort Expectations
  - Have a shared calendar (google calendar or Calendly?) for us to schedule times when we will work on project tasks throughout the week 
  - Gives us one reliable record to keep us all on the same page
  - Allows us to see each other’s availability at a glance (so we don't wonder when people will reply, etc)
  - Discourages procrastination since we set aside blocks of time to work on the project (and adds accountability since everyone can see it)
  - Gives us an idea of how much work we can actually get done
  - Makes sure no one is doing too much work
  - If your availability changes, just update the calendar and send a slack notification
  - It’s ok if people can only schedule a few hours for some weeks, the point is to have transparency so we can plan ahead better

## Decisions
- Team Name
  - Biggest Lunchbox. Decided on majority vote.
- Introduction Video
  - Personal introduction + rap for entire team brand
  - Intro video about yourself. Name and fun fact.
  - Everyone say, "We are big lunchbox" at the end.
  - Elevator music intros into rough transition.
- Operating Rules
  - Sunday: 10 am Weekly Meetings
  - Plan to have a team google calendar with blocked out times for working for each person for accountability?
  - Stay after class on Tue/Thur for 10-15min max
