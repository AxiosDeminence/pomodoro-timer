    - CI/CD Pipeline is present and there were plans for cross-platform testing
    - Good code coverage and looks like it was written by one person
    - No backend so no need to learn new APIs and implementing a backend gives us freedom to choose and a stricter domain
  - Brooks' Repo
    - Fun project to learn fullstack web dev and useful for people who want to learn how to cook and not knowing what to took
    - Clean documentation for each function with organizational documents
    - Several servers to keep track of and with many manual steps to lint code
    - Code is clean but there's a lot and the directory structure is confusing
    - It has 3 different APIs that we would need to learn
- Phase 2 Slides (enumerates above discussions)
